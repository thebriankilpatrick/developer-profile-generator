# Developer Profile Generator  

What follows is week nine homework for the University of Richmond Coding Boot Camp.  
The Developer Profile Generator is a node command line application, that allows
the user to input a github user to generate a developer profile PDF.  

### Uses and How to Use  

Using the node command line, the application will be invoked using the command: "node index.js".  
The user will then be prompted to provide a github username, as well as a color.  
With the user's input, a developer profile will be generated with some information pulled from github.  

Refer to the gif below to see it in action.
